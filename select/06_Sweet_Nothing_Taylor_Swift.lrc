[00:17.33] I spy with my little tired eye
[00:20.39] Tiny as a firefly
[00:22.48] A pebble that we picked up last July
[00:26.30] Down deep inside your pocket
[00:29.11] We almost forgot it
[00:31.27] Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
[00:34.83] Ooh...
[00:37.83] 
[00:44.06] They said the end is coming
[00:46.32] Everyone's up to something
[00:48.25] I find myself running home to your
[00:50.35] Sweet nothings
[00:52.59] Outside they're push and shoving
[00:54.77] You're in the kitchen humming
[00:56.87] All that you ever wanted from me was
[00:58.98] Sweet nothing
[01:05.48] 
[01:09.67] On the way home
[01:11.72] I wrote a poem
[01:14.01] You say, "what a mind"
[01:15.95] This happens all the time
[01:17.25] Ooh...
[01:20.25] 
[01:26.59] 'Cause they said the end is coming
[01:28.95] Everyone's up to something
[01:31.29] I find myself running home to your
[01:33.33] Sweet nothings
[01:35.48] Outside they're push and shoving
[01:37.44] You're in the kitchen humming
[01:39.88] All that you ever wanted from me was
[01:41.96] ... nothing
[01:47.46] 
[01:43.04] Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
[01:46.78] And smooth-talking hucksters
[01:49.28] Out glad-handing each other
[01:51.16] And the voices that implore
[01:53.56] "You should be doing more"
[01:55.57] To you I can admit
[01:57.66] That I'm just too soft for all of it
[02:15.66] 
[02:09.26] Ooh...
[02:12.26] 
[02:18.33] They said the end is coming
[02:20.60] Everyone's up to something
[02:22.63] I find myself running home to your
[02:24.76] Sweet nothings
[02:26.94] Outside they're push and shoving
[02:29.08] You're in the kitchen humming
[02:31.14] All that you ever wanted from me was
[02:33.22] Sweet nothing
[02:39.72] 
[02:35.55] They said the end is coming
[02:37.51] Everyone's up to something
[02:39.68] I find myself running home to your
[02:41.77] Sweet nothings
[02:44.13] Outside they're push and shoving
[02:46.13] You're in the kitchen humming
[02:48.13] All that you ever wanted from me was
[02:50.52] Sweet nothing
